## Custom Styles

The original theme's (v0.1.2) documentation state (March 19th 2018) for custom styles is incomplete and inaccurate.
To develop locally:
1. `git clone <repo> && cd <repo dir>`
2. `npm install` (`yarn` may work here)
3. `cd themes/doc/`
4. `npm install` (`yarn` does not seem to work here)
5. `cd` back to root repo dir and `npm run start` or `yarn start`
